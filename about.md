## About the blog

In this blog, you will read about small everyday tips&tricks, technical articles, tests, etc. When i started to use Linux i had to make some changes on the system to make it more comfortable. In the early days i did not write the solution down, but that was a mistake. The next time, when i faced with the exact same problem, i didn't remember to the solution. So i started to write these little things down, to make them reusable, and possibly these snippets of codes/settings/thoughts will be helpful for other beginners.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy your time!
