The original source can be found [here](https://href.li/?http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/744). In this post, we will write a linux live system on a flas usb drive using the linux command line tool dd. [man dd](http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man1/dd.1.php)

    $ sudo dd if=~/Desktop/linuxmint.iso of=/dev/sdx oflag=direct bs=1048576

Where **if** stands for input-file (should be an .iso), **of** stands for output-file, the target USB drive. **oflag** is intended to speed up the process, therefore, its not mandatory. If you can't find out your flash drive's path, try

    $ sudo fdisk -l

> **Warning**: Make sure to set the correct device path, as this process will delete all data that was on the specified device previously!

Remember, don’t include an integer for the USB drive, e.g. ‘/dev/sdx1′, as it would refer to the existing partition on that drive and not the drive itself. When the USB has been properly created by ‘dd’, there should be an output similar to this:

```console
$ sudo dd if=~/Desktop/linuxmint.iso of=/dev/sdb oflag=direct bs=1048576
706+1 records in
706+1 records out
740601856 bytes (741 MB) copied, 91.7024 s, 8.1 MB/s
```
