In this post I will show you an easy way to express your thoughts via the static site and blog motor `Jekyll`. We will host our blog on `github pages` for **free**! To set up a starter skeleton project only takes a few minutes.

[TOC]

# Preface

My story started ~6 years ago, when I first wanted to do some "blogging". On the early days, I used some really simple, and free blogging motors, like blogspot, and others I can hardly remember their names. Later on I started a blog about my sports life, about my training. It was like a diary of mine on the net around the topic of the gym. It was sufficient for my solely purpose. Then, after a few years I wanted to start a semi-personal blog about technology and stuff. I wanted to archive somewhere my findings about the Unix world, and save some snippets about programming. I started to use Wordpress, but I was overly unsatisfied with it. It was such a pain in the ass to create a new blog post, it was time consuming, and I couldn't insert code snippets properly in it. Also, when I wanted to modify my blog on the slightest level, wordpress made it nearly impossible for me. I wanted something, what is

* Simple ~easy to use
* Free
* Can use code snippets with syntax highlighting

Finally, I've found :octocat: pages which runs Jekyll on it. So I started to use Jekyll for static site blogging and it's awesome, belive me :)

# About Jekyll

So what is `Jekyll`? The original website of Jekyll's is very good, and descriptive. So, everything I write down here, is just a shortcut of the information what can be found on the general Jekyll website. http://jekyllrb.com/ I advise it very much, to read it properly. It's not so long, and it is concise. Otherwise, read my blog post for a summary.

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

Here it is, that simple. Jekyll is just a tool to create web friendly content out of text files. Usually from *markdown + html + some config files*. The idea is simple, let the user write some templates, let the user also write blog posts in simple text format (`textile`, `markdown`, etc), and let the framework do the magic which means creating static html content from the text files, and the output is ready to serve out with a webserver. *Hint: the hosting will be done by GitHub.*

# An optional work flow

When our blog is ready, we will post new posts as follows:

1. Open the sublime project of our blog
2. Hit `CTRL+K`; `CTRL+P` -> this will create a new post with the datas needed by jekyll
3. Finish writing the post
4. We publish the new post to our CVS, our CVS will be git, and we will push the new post to github
5. Our new post will be available in an instant

The whole process is faster, more elegant, and imho the output is prettier than it was when I used Wordpress for blogging.

# Prerequisites

1. You need a github account first. Visit https://github.com/ and create a free acoount.
2. On github, create a new repository, called <your_username>.github.io
3. You will need `ruby`, `bundler` and `jekyll` on your system. Install ruby and jekyll via `apt` on *buntu systems, and bundler via `gem` which comes with ruby. Gem is a package manager for ruby.

After install, I have these versions of those on my system

```bash
$ ruby --version
ruby 1.9.3p484 (2013-11-22 revision 43786) [x86_64-linux]
$ jekyll --version
jekyll 2.4.0
$ bundle --version
Bundler version 1.7.9
```

4. Later on, you will most probably need `python` as well, for syntax highlighting.

# Scaffolding

Okay, so after installing the dependencies, we are ready to create our blog. We will start with generating a jekyll skeleton site. Since we will sooner or later host this blog on github, it's time to clone the repo we created.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/s1ngul4rity/s1ngul4rity.github.io.git
Cloning into 's1ngul4rity.github.io'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

This command have created a folder named `s1ngul4rity.github.io/`, we will scaffold our blog into the root of this directory.

```bash
$ cd s1ngul4rity.github.io/
$ jekyll new temp
New jekyll site installed in /home/jim-y/tmp/s1ngul4rity.github.io/temp. 
$ cp -R temp/* .
$ rm -rf temp/
```

Now, our repo root contains some documents generated by jekyll. The generated skeleton app is ready to run, so first, before introducing the jekyll "framework" let's have a look at the skeleton app. In the root directory of our blog, in `s1ngul4rity.github.io/` bootstrap our blog by:

```bash
$ jekyll serve
Configuration file: /home/jim-y/tmp/s1ngul4rity.github.io/_config.yml
            Source: /home/jim-y/tmp/s1ngul4rity.github.io
       Destination: /home/jim-y/tmp/s1ngul4rity.github.io/_site
      Generating... 
                    done.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/home/jim-y/tmp/s1ngul4rity.github.io'
Configuration file: /home/jim-y/tmp/s1ngul4rity.github.io/_config.yml
    Server address: http://0.0.0.0:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

The `jekyll serve` command created a webserver on localhost:4000 serving out our static files. So point your browser on `localhost:4000` and have a look at the application.

So far, so good. Technically speaking, you could end up here, and start publishing your blog to github, since it is fully functinal, but I assume, you want to learn some more about jekyll first, and I bet, the skeleton blog's appearance is not sufficient enough :)

# Architecture

It's time to inspect the architecture of the created boilerplate.

```bash
.
├── about.md
├── _config.yml
├── css
├── feed.xml
├── _includes
├── index.html
├── _layouts
├── _posts
├── README.md
├── _sass
└── _site
```

### index.html

As every decent website, our blog also needs a main page. In jekyll this is `index.html`. We need to prepend this file (all files) with a YAML Front Matter section which is needed for Jekyll to be able to indentify, that it needs to parse the file upon the build process.

A [YAML Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) is a section of code on the top of a file, which tells Jekyll that this file needs to be processed. On `process`, we mean traversing the file, and processing [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/) templates. Jekyll uses Liquid templating.

### about.md and other [.html, .md, .markdown] files in root

A Jekyll blog consists of `posts` and `pages`. Posts are .. surprise, surprise .. posts, be fair, the world knows these as articles :D, pages are general static html pages, these will be available on the `http://localhost:4000/about/`. You can make an about page, where you introduce yourself, or you could create a contact page, where you put your online media accounts and addresses.

### _config.yml

This is your blog's main config page, where you set up things like `baseurl` and stuff. More about this later.

### ./_posts

The posts older contains your articles. The naming of your posts are very strict and concise.

> The naming convention of these files is important, and must follow the format: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP.

Technically speaking, the creating of a new post is as simple as creating a new markup file in the ./_posts folder with the required naming.

### ./_layouts, ./_includes

`_includes` is the folder for reusable markups/html. Think of it as the place where you put a header.html segment what needs to be appended on every page of your blog.

`_layouts` is the folder for site templates. Usually your posts will have a template, where you will render the content, as well as your pages, and you should have a default template for your main page.

### ./_site

`_site` is a folder which is generated programmatically by jekyll. GitHub will create such files which are inside this folder upon build. If you want to host your blog on your own, you will need to serve up these files on a webserver. We will put this folder into `.gitignore`.

### Every other file

Every other file stays as it is. We usually want some assets in our posts, like images. So we will create a folder for assets.

# Creation

In this section, we will be setting up additional things to make our skeleton site unique.

### Gemfile

As [github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) tutorial says, we need a Gemfile in the root directory. So create it.

```bash
$ sublime Gemfile

source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
```

Next add `_site` folder to .gitignore. If you doesn't have a `.gitignore` file, create it. Now, before going further, take some minute and think about the look and feel. Obviously, the basic skeleton is coming with a very basic theme. You would probably change it for something better. Since I suck in CSS, I will download a free theme for my blog. :)

# Theming

Browse jekyllthemes.org for a suitable theme. In this tutorial, I will use [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) which is a nice multi color theme from *poole*. I'm currently using poole's other theme, *lanyon* on my blog. Setting up theme is easy, but we need to remove nearly all of the boilerplate what jekyll generated for us.

```bash
$ pwd
/home/jim-y/tmp/s1ngul4rity.github.io
$ rm -rf *.html *.xml css/ _cong.yml _includes/ _layouts/ old/ public/ _sass/ .sass-cache/ _site/
```

Now, that we have space, download the theme and copy over the source files.

```bash
$ cd ..
$ git clone https://github.com/poole/hyde.git
$ cd hyde/
$ cp -Rf 404.html about.md atom.xml _config.yml _includes/ index.html _layouts/ public/ ../s1ngul4rity.github.io/
```

Now, if you have done everything right, you should be able to build your newly themed blog.

```bash
$ cd .. && cd s1ngul4rity.github.io/
$ jekyll serve
```

# Syntax highlighting

With the new theme, we switched to `pygments` highlighter from the default `kramdown.` The highlighting is good enough, but could be better. Why? Just because we are running a technical blog, and we will be publishing code snippets all the time. So how to add a new highlighter?

It's very simple. Just replace the `./public/css/syntax.css` file with another. I use github highlighting so I made these modifications.

```bash
$ cd public/css/
$ mv syntax.css syntax.css.old
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mojombo/tpw/master/css/syntax.css
```

Also, we can append line numbers for our gists, but the style of these line numbers are not so good. But we can solve the problem by appending these two lines for syntax.css. [Credits](http://demisx.github.io/jekyll/2014/01/13/improve-code-highlighting-in-jekyll.html)

```css
.post > .highlight .lineno { color: #ccc; display:inline-block; padding: 0 5px; border-right:1px solid #ccc; }
.post > .highlight pre code { display: block; white-space: pre; overflow-x: auto; word-wrap: normal; }
```

Another solution for code blocks, is to insert a github gist to your post. With Liquid it's simple too. Just write `{% gist 8d84463549b5adbc19d3 %}` in your post.

# Configure socials

With Liquid, and `_config.yml`, you can insert metadata in your posts/pages. First, rewrite our theme's _config.yml a little bit. As stated at [gh-pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#configuring-jekyll), GitHub will insert some metadata information to your site. You can use these datas in your pages. To test it out, let's rewrite `./_includes/sidebar.html` to append our `twitter` account after the description, like

    Blabla Welcome here - @twitter_link

So, modify sidebar.html as follows

```html
<div class="sidebar-about">
  <h1>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">
      {{ site.title }}
    </a>
  </h1>
  <p class="lead">{{ site.description }} - <a href="{{ site.author.url }}">@{{ site.author.name }}</a></p>
 </div>
```

The pinpoint here is the Liquid directive `{{ site.author.url }}` and `{{ site.author.name }}`. These values come from the `_config.yml`. Now, let's rewrite

```html
<a class="sidebar-nav-item" href="{{ site.github.repo }}">GitHub project</a>
```

that we doesn't get the repo name directly from the config file, instead we will use github's injection as stated [here](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-metadata-on-github-pages/). Mind, that locally it won't work, only when we will host our files on GitHub.

```html
<a class="sidebar-nav-item" href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}">GitHub project</a>
```

The site.github namespace will be injected upon gh-build. The final config file looks like:

```bash
# Dependencies - "fenced_code_blocks" is automatically enabled
markdown: redcarpet
redcarpet:
  extensions: ["no_intra_emphasis", "autolink", "tables", "with_toc_data"]
highlighter: pygments

# Permalinks
permalink: pretty
relative_permalinks: true

# Setup

url: https://github.com/s1ngul4rity/s1ngul4rity.github.io
baseurl: /

  url: https://twitter.com/attilakling

paginate: 5

# Custom vars
version: 0.0.1
```

# Writing posts

As mentioned in the preface, the workflow is rather simple, and elegant. For making it so, I downloaded a `Sublime` [plugin](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Jekyll) which adds some jekyll functionality to my editor.

Let's create a new post.

1. `$ cd s1ngul4rity.github.io/`
2. `sublime .`
3. In sublime, `CTRL+K`; `CTRL+P`
4. Type in a new post name
5. A new post appeared in the directory you already set up when you installed the jekyll plugin in sublime. It should be your blog's `_posts` directory.
6. The front-matter section is prefilled for you, as shown below.

```json
---
layout: post
title: Welcome post
published: True
categories: []
tags: []
---
```

You can use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) syntax in your posts.

# Deploy

It's time to deploy our blog to the host, up to github. For this, we need to use the `git` CVS.

```bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -a -m 'Initial Commit'
[master e0c97e4] Initial Commit

```

That's it, your core jekyll files, except `_site/` is pushed to GitHub, and your page should be online after some minutes. Give them some time to bootstrap your site. The blog will be available at http://s1ngul4rity.github.io/
