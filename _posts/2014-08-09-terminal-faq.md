The linux terminal is a powerful tool what every linux user should learn to use.

## Tweaks

### Colors

Edit `.bashrc` and search for `#force_color_prompt=yes`, uncomment it. Then set color by editing

```bash
if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
  PS1=â€™${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[33[01;32m\]\u@\h\[33[00m\]:\[\
```

### Commands

Create own command by defining a new function.

```bash
function cdls(){ cd $1; ls -l; }
```

Usage `cdls directory/`

### Horizontal rule

The [project](https://href.li/?https://github.com/LuRsT/hr). If already not exists, create a ~/bin/ directory, and perform these commands:

```bash
curl https://raw.github.com/LuRsT/hr/master/hr > ~/bin/hr 
# or, in case curl is not installed
wget https://raw.github.com/LuRsT/hr/master/hr > ~/bin/hr

chmod +x ~/bin/hr
```

add that bin directory to your PATH (`echo $PATH`), and enjoy your hr time :)
