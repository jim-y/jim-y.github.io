During your learn, it could happen that you will need a webserver to serve files from your hard-drive. Like in this case [react tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html#updating-state). In such case python has a one-liner to help you out. 

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Trigger this command in your project's root directory and then point your browser to `localhost:8000`.
